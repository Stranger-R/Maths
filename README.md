# ðŸ“Š C++ Project: Statistics and Matrix Operations from Scratch

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction

This project is designed specifically for **first-year college students** studying **Mathematics**, **Computer Science**, or **Engineering**. It serves as a practical learning aid by implementing essential **statistical functions** and **matrix operations** using C++ â€” one of the most foundational programming languages in academia.

All logic has been written from scratch using core concepts of C++, making this a great starter project to understand both programming and mathematics at the same time.

## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

By exploring and modifying this project, students will:

- Understand how to calculate statistical measures manually.
- Learn the basics of matrix algebra.
- Practice input validation and structured programming.
- Get hands-on experience in using functions, arrays, loops, and conditionals in C++.
- Strengthen logic-building skills.

### ðŸ”¢ Statistics Module
| Function             | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mean**             | Calculates the average value of a dataset                                  |
| **Median**           | Finds the middle value when data is sorted                                 |
| **Mode**             | Detects the number(s) that occur most frequently                           |
| **Variance**         | Measures the spread of the numbers in the dataset                          |
| **Standard Deviation** | Calculates how much the numbers deviate from the mean                    |

### ðŸ§® Matrix Operations
| Operation             | Description                                                             |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Addition**          | Adds corresponding elements of two matrices                             |
| **Subtraction**       | Subtracts corresponding elements of two matrices                        |
| **Multiplication**    | Multiplies two matrices using the dot product                           |

> ðŸ”º Note: Multiplication is only allowed if the number of columns in Matrix A equals the number of rows in Matrix B.
